# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my portfolio website. I just made it while I was busy for my another work. This is live site link: [Shaker Ahamed](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Introduction
This website is not custom designed. I was inspired from anther portfolio website named [Trueman](https://themeforest.net/item/trueman-cv-resume-wordpress-theme/37364785). I actually liked their design and tried to make another one for me. I didn't copied everything's from them. I made it in a different way and changed some design.

So, this is my one page portfolio website. If you need me anyway just send me an email from this website and I will be always there for you. Thanks.
